   ## Git Basics
  I was not familiar with Git before, as well as the 
  Frontend in general, so it was interesting experience 
  for me to   get new material on this course. For me there is a lot 
  of new useful information that I will use in practice 
  in the future. Thanks to the Kottans for support 
  and motivation to move on.

  ## Linux CLI, and HTTP
  In this module, almost everything was new for me, so it was nice to find familiar commands from the previous module.
  It was a great experience, and I will definitely use it in my future work.

  After completing reading articles about HTTP protocols I learned about:

  - HTTP headers, status codes, messages, responses, requests;
  - identification and authentication;
  - HTTPS;
  
    and discovered interesting features like:
    
  - types of headers;
  - using HTTP in web frameworks examples.
  
  ## Git Collaboration  
  A very powerful course! As always, I've learned a lot of new things:
  - how to create pull requests; 
  - work in a local repository with two remote branches (origin and upstream branches);
  - how to squash commits interactively. 
  
  I am sure, all this knowledge will be useful to me in practice in the future.
